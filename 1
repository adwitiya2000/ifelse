Given an integer,n, perform the following conditional actions:

If n is odd, print Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird
If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird
If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

Input Format
    A single line containing a positive integer, .

Constraints
    1<=n<=100
Output Format
    Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

Sample Input 0  Sample Output 0
3               Weird

Explanation 0
    3 is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

Sample Input 1  Sample Output 1
24              Not Weird

Explanation 1
    24>20 and 24 is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.

    elif(n>=2 & n<5):
        print('Not Weird')

    print('Weird')
